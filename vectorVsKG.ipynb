All three peptides contain the newly characterized bonnevillic acid moiety (3-(3,5-dichloro-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-hydroxyacrylic acid), as well as a heavily modified proline residue. Moreover, in bonnevillamide A, the terminal proline residue found in bonnevillamides B and C is replaced with 4-methyl-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester. The structures of the three heptapeptides were elucidated by NMR, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (HRESIMS), and LC-MS/MS, and the absolute configuration of all proteinogenic amino acid residues were determined by advanced Marfey's method. Bonnevillamides A, B and C were evaluated for their effects on zebrafish embryo development. All three heptapeptides were shown to modulate heart growth and cardiac function, with bonnevillamide B having the most pronounced effect.\",\n",

HRQOL was evaluated using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory SF15 (PedsQL; children) and Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI; parent proxy) before and after a 3-month stationary cycling intervention. Sixty-two children (29 male, 33 female; mean age 11y; range 7-18y) with spastic diplegic CP, classified as levels I to III on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, were enrolled. Paired and independent t-tests were used to evaluate within- and between-group differences respectively.RESULTS: Between-group differences, favoring the cycling group, were found for PedsQL emotional functioning (p=0.046) and Parental PODCI treatment expectations scores (p=0.006). Between-group differences were not found for other scales. Within-group improvements were found in the cycling group: PedsQL total score (+5.8; p=0.006), psychosocial health summary (+6.9; p=0.008), and school functioning (+8.0; p=0.038). PODCI satisfaction with symptoms decreased significantly only in the control group (-12.0; p=0.046).INTERPRETATION: A beneficial influence of exercise on pediatric emotional well-being and parental treatment expectations was found. The evidence was not strong for other aspects of HRQOL. Results support the positive relationship between physical fitness and emotional well-being in the general population. A child's perception is important when examining change in his or her emotional well-being due to intervention.\",\n",

Patients were followed up with computed tomography of the chest and the abdomen every 3 months. All patients were followed up until February 2014.RESULTS: In January 2014, 11 patients were still alive with a median survival of 11 months, eight patients developed a recurrence and two patients died at 8 and 9 months after surgery. After 1 year from macroscopic radical pleurectomy decortication, a 68-year-old man suffered from gingival mass turned out to be a metastatic deposit of biphasic malignant mesothelioma as first sign of multiorgan recurrence.

In a third patient, an apical dental infection was associated with fistulated osteomyelitis. Histology of the three sequestra showed an intraosseous squamous proliferation. It was characterized by a peripheral involvement of medullary spaces, the more mature epithelial layer covering the bone trabeculae without intervening stroma, and the basal type epithelial layer surrounding a central fibrovascular core. There were no histological or cytological signs of malignancy.CONCLUSION: PH shows an inverted pattern when compared with the centro-medullary tumoural islands seen in the various oral or odontogenic squamous neoplasms which occur in the jaws. The lack of signs of malignancy distinguish PH from common squamous cell carcinomas. A short clinical course is an important feature in the distinction of PH from the well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas which may develop in fistulated chronic osteomyelitis.\",\n",

The most frequent clinical presentation includes fever, weight loss, nasal obstruction, epistaxis, nasal or facial edema, as well as necrotic ulcers in the nasal cavity, gums, and palate. It has been found to have an important association with the Epstein-Barr virus. Diagnostic pathology could be difficult due to the typical widespread tissue necrosis. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old Caucasian male sought medical attention with a chief complaint of nasal obstruction for the past 3 years, which only responded partially to unspecific treatment. He also presented with intermittent fever and nocturnal hyperhidrosis. Physical examination with rhinoscopy demonstrated a deviated septum, congestive turbines, and fragile and pale mucous membrane with yellowish, thick mucus. The pathology report described an angiocentric centrofacial lymphoma and a positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus. CONCLUSIONS The objective of this case report was to show that this illness represents a diagnostic challenge for the treating physician. It may be concluded that despite the poor prognosis of the disease, this particular case showed slower evolution and the patient remained stable despite multiple consecutive complications.\",\n",

The treatment of choice is a large surgical resection, while radiotherapy and chemotherapy are reserved for recurrences. The authors present a case of oropharyngeal malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The patient complained dysphagia and dyslalia progressively worsening in six months. Pharyngo-laryngoscopy revealed a mass of the left lateral wall of oro and hypopharynx. CT scan examination showed a capsuled mass which displaced but not involved the neck neurovascular structures; there was no evidence of linphonodal involvement. Transoral surgical excision of the mass was performed with the preservation of speech and swallowing. For more than 1 year postoperatively, there has been no evidence of the disease or metastasis.\",\n",

The frequency of occurrence of neoplasms at different sites was: diaphragm, 45%; ribs, 14%; vertebrae, 14%; femora, 9%; pelvic bones, 5%; tibiae, 4%; sternebrae, 3%; and inguinal area, 7%. The neoplasms were characterized histologically by elongated or rounded cells associated with an abundant connective tissue stroma. Occasional areas of bone formation and apparent osteoid metaplasia were seen. Bone tumors appeared to arise from periosteal cells, to grow by expansion, and to invade locally, but they failed to metastasize. Neoplasms of the diaphragm originated in the central aponeurosis and appeared histologically similar to bone neoplasms. Histochemical studies demonstrated abundant alkaline phosphatase in tumor cells, and ultrastructural observations revealed subcellular characteristics of osteoblasts and chondroblasts. Tumors were readily transplantable and had histopathological characteristics similar to those of the primary viral-induced tumors. The results of this study indicate that the FBJ virus induces in NIH Swiss mice a unique type of chondroosseous neoplasm derived from periosteal cells which has a resemblance to human juxtacortical (parosteal) osteosarcoma.\",\n",

Elderly patients are considered higher risk for these radical operations and are commonly not offered surgical treatment. We reviewed our experience with extended pleurectomy and decortication among patients 70 years or older and compared them with a cohort of younger patients undergoing extended pleurectomy and decortication for malignant pleural mesothelioma.METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 117 consecutive patients undergoing extended pleurectomy and decortication at a university hospital from January 2008 to December 2013. Patients 70 years and older were compared with younger patients for postoperative outcome and survival. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were 70 years or older; 63 were younger than 70 years. Older patients had more hypertension (71.2% versus 45.2%; p = 0.004) and coronary artery disease (22.6% versus 6.5%; p = 0.006). Major complications occurred in 3 patients (5.5%) in the older group and in 7 patients (11.1%) of the younger group (not significant). There were 2 deaths in each group after surgery (3.7% older versus 3.2% younger; not significant). Median survival was 15.6 months in the older patients and 14.0 months in the younger patients (not significant). Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on age groups were not significantly different with 1- and 2-year survivals of 64% versus 55% and 29% versus 32%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that whereas age may be associated with more comorbid conditions in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma undergoing extended pleurectomy and decortication, this does not necessarily translate into increased operative morbidity or mortality or shorter long-term survival.\",\n",

Women below the age of 50 had an unusually long survival, even after adjustment for the effects of other variables in the model.

We identified 5 patients (median age 56 y, all men) with diffuse intrapulmonary malignant mesothelioma in our pathology consultation practice from 2009 to 2012. Clinical history, imaging, and pathology materials were reviewed. Symptoms included chronic dyspnea (4 cases), cough (3), and acute dyspnea with bilateral pneumothorax (1). Chest imaging showed irregular opacities (5), reticulation (4), pleural effusions (2), and subpleural nodular densities (1), without radiologic evidence of pleural disease or masses. A clinicoradiologic diagnosis of ILD was made in all cases, and wedge biopsies were performed. Histologic evaluation revealed a neoplastic proliferation of bland epithelioid or spindled cells, showing various growth patterns simulating silicotic nodules, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Some areas mimicked adenocarcinoma, with lepidic, acinar, micropapillary, and solid patterns. Initial diagnoses by referring pathologists included reactive changes (1), hypersensitivity pneumonitis versus drug reaction (1), desquamative interstitial pneumonia versus neoplasm (1), and mesothelioma (2).

      "Abstract: A gingival tumor that invaded the anterior maxilla was removed from a 14-year-old boy and studied by light and electron microscopy. The tumor was composed exclusively of myoepithelial cells and appeared to be malignant. By light microscopy, the tumor appeared to be a poorly differentiated epithelial neoplasm of undetermined origin; however, electron microscopical examination showed myoepithelial differentiation, indicative of a salivary gland origin. To our knowledge, the present case represents the only confirmed myoepithelioma that shows features indicative of malignant potential. Myoepitheliomas may be related to mixed tumors of salivary glands.\n",

      "Title: NDRG1 deficiency is associated with regional metastasis in oral cancer by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\n",
      "Abstract: Regional metastasis is the single most important prognostic factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Abnormal expression of N-myc downstream-regulated genes (NDRGs) has been identified to occur in several tumor types and to predict poor prognosis. In OSCC, the clinical significance of deregulated NDRG expression has not been fully established. In this study, NDRG1 relevance was assessed at gene and protein levels in 100 OSCC patients followed up by at least 10 years. Survival outcome was analyzed using a multivariable analysis. Tumor progression and metastasis was investigated in preclinical model using oral cancer cell lines (HSC3 and SCC25) treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and orthotopic mouse model of metastatic murine OSCC (AT84). We identified NDRG1 expression levels to be significantly lower in patients with metastatic tumors compared with patients with local disease only (P = 0.001). NDRG1 expression was associated with MMP-2, -9, -10 (P = 0.022, P = 0.002, P = 0.042, respectively) and BCL2 (P = 0.035). NDRG1 lower expression was able to predict recurrence and metastasis (log-rank test, P = 0.001). In multivariable analysis, the expression of NDRG1 was an independent prognostic factor (Cox regression, P = 0.013). In invasive OSCC cells, NDRG1 expression is diminished in response to EGF and this was associated with a potent induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype. This result was further confirmed in an orthotopic OSCC mouse model. Together, this data support that NDRG1 downregulation is a potential predictor of metastasis and approaches aimed at NDRG1 signaling rescue can serve as potential therapeutic strategy to prevent oral cancer progression to metastasis.\n",

      "Abstract: TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a member of IêB Kinase (IKK)-related kinases, plays a role in regulating innate immunity, inflammation and oncogenic signaling. This study aims to investigate the role of BX795, an inhibitor of TBK1, in a panel of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. The antitumor effects and mechanisms of BX795 were assessed by MTT assays, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. BX795 exhibited a dose-responsive antiproliferative effect on OSCC cells with relative sparing of normal human oral keratinocytes. The compound caused apoptosis as evidenced by PARP cleavage, the presence of pyknotic nuclei in the TUNEL assay, and fragmented DNA tails in the Comet assay. BX795 inhibits Akt and NF-êB signaling, arrests cells in the mitotic phase, and increases generation of autophagy in oral cancer cells. Interestingly, the antiproliferative activity of BX795 does not correlate with TBK1 protein expression level in OSCC cells. We propose that the TBK1-independet effect is related to mitotic phase arrest. Pleiotropic anticancer activity with relative sparing of normal oral keratinocytes underscores the potential value of BX795 and warrants its further study in oral squamous cell carcinoma therapy.\n",
