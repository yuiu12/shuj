Cologne\nprosecutors sought German-born J\u00fcrgen Mossack  and Panamanian Ram\u00f3n Fonseca  on charges of\naccessory to tax evasion and forming a criminal organization.[25]\nIn June 2024, a judge in Panama acquitted all former Mossack Fonseca employees, including the\ntwo founders, due to insufficient evidence  and problems with the chain of custody  of evidence.\nIn additio n to the much-covered business dealings of British prime minister David Cameron  and\nIcelandic prime minister Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson , the leaked documents also contain\nidentity information about the shareholders and directors of 214,000 shell companies set up by\nMossack Fonseca , as well as some  of their financial transactions. Although it is gener ally not\nagainst the law to own an offshore shell company, reporters found  that some of the shell\ncorporations were used for illegal purposes, including fraud, tax evasion, and evading international\nsanctions.\nThe journalists on the investigative team found business transactions by many important figures in\nworld politics, sports, and art. While many of the transactions were  legal, since the data is\nincomplete, questi ons remain in man y other cases; still others seem to clearly indicate ethical if not\nlegal impropriety. Some disclosures \u2013 tax avoidance  in very poor countries by very wealthy entities\nand indiv iduals for example \u2013 led to questions on moral grounds. For example, the shell company\nOctea is registered to Beny Steinmetz  and owes more than US$700,000 in property taxes to the\ncity of Koidu  in Sierra Leone , and is $150 million in debt, even though its exports  were more than\ntwice that in an average month in the 2012\u20132015 period.[26][27] Steinmetz himself has a personal\nworth of $6 billion.[27]\nOther offshore shell company transactions described in the documents do seem to have broken\nexchange laws, violated trade sanctions or stemmed from political corruption, according to ICIJ\nreporters. For example:\nUruguay has arrested \ufb01ve people and charged them with money-laundering  through Mossack\nFonseca shell companies for a Mexican drug cartel .[ 2 8 ]\nOuestaf , an ICIJ partner in the investigation, reported that it had discovered new evidence that\nKarim W ade received payments from DP World (DP). He and a long-time friend were convicted\nof this in a trial that the United Nations  and Amnesty International  said was unfair and violated\nthe defendants' rights.
